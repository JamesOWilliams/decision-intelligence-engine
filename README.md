# Decision Intelligence Engine — Organizational Readiness MVP

> An enterprise operational readiness instrument for AI initiatives.
> Evidence-driven scoring, ontology-weighted evaluation, blocker-aware recommendations,
> and Claude-generated consultative executive briefings.

**Not** a chatbot. **Not** a generic scoring tool. An *instrument* for enterprise leadership
to evaluate whether an AI initiative can realistically be executed, absorbed, and sustained.

---

## ✦ What This Is

The Decision Intelligence Engine (DIE) evaluates the **Organizational Readiness** of an AI
initiative across five weighted dimensions:

| # | Dimension                          | Weight |
|---|------------------------------------|--------|
| 1 | Change Management Maturity         | 25%    |
| 2 | Stakeholder Alignment              | 20%    |
| 3 | Operational Ownership Clarity      | 25%    |
| 4 | Cross-Functional Coordination      | 20%    |
| 5 | Training & Enablement Readiness    | 10%    |

The engine produces:
- **Domain score** (0–100) with maturity band (Minimal → Institutionalized)
- **Confidence calibration** (Low / Moderate / High) based on completeness + consistency
- **Recommendation tier** (Not Ready → Production Candidate), downgraded by triggered blockers
- **Strengths / risks / prioritized remediation actions**
- **Claude-generated consultative executive narrative**
- **Shareable boardroom briefing** with auto-generated 2–4 sentence executive abstract

### Critical architectural separation
- The **scoring engine is fully deterministic Python** — no LLM in the scoring path.
- The **LLM (Claude Sonnet 4.5) only explains** the pre-computed scores — it never alters numbers, tier, or blocker logic.

## ✦ Local Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Python** 3.11+
- **Node.js** 18+ and **Yarn**
- **MongoDB** running locally (or remote URI)
- An **Anthropic API key** *or* an Emergent Universal LLM Key

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `backend/.env`:

```env
MONGO_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017"
DB_NAME="die_database"
CORS_ORIGINS="*"
EMERGENT_LLM_KEY="<your-emergent-universal-key-or-anthropic-key>"
```

Run the backend:

```bash
uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
```

Health check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health
# → {"status":"ok","ontology_version":"1.0.0"}
```

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install
```

Create `frontend/.env`:

```env
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8001"
```

Run the frontend:

```bash
yarn start
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>.

> **Note:** On the Emergent preview environment, services are managed by `supervisorctl` (`sudo supervisorctl restart backend|frontend`) and `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` is pre-configured to the public ingress URL.

## ✦ Demo Flow (≈2 minutes)

A seeded scenario — **"Enterprise AI Knowledge Assistant Rollout"** — calibrated to score
**72 / Structured / Proceed to Constrained Pilot** so reviewers can see the full briefing
without filling out an assessment manually.

### Option A — Click through the demo briefing
1. Open the app at `/`.
2. Click **"View demo briefing"** (top-right or hero CTA).
3. You're routed straight to `/report/<demo-id>` showing the executive briefing.
4. Click **Share Briefing** → copy the URL → open in a new tab to see the
   boardroom-style `/shared/<token>` view (with the Claude-generated 2–4 sentence executive abstract).
5. Click **Export PDF** to invoke the `@media print` stylesheet.

### Option B — Run a new assessment end-to-end
1. Click **"Begin a new assessment"** on the landing page.
2. Fill the **Initiative Intake** form and choose a stage (Discovery / Pilot / Production Candidate).
3. Move through the **Evidence Assessment** workspace — 27 indicators across 5 dimensions, each with
   a 5-segment maturity selector (Not Started → Operationalized). The right-rail **Readiness Pulse**
   updates live as you answer.
4. At ≥70% completion, click **Generate Executive Briefing** to call the LLM and produce the report.

### Option C — Reset the seeded demo via API
```bash
curl -X POST $BACKEND_URL/api/assessments/seed-demo
```

## ✦ Tests

The backend pytest suite covers scoring determinism, blocker logic, share idempotency,
telemetry, and LLM integration shape:

```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/test_die_backend.py -v
# 25/25 passing
```

Frontend production build sanity (zero ESLint warnings expected):

```bash
cd frontend
yarn build
```

---

## ✦ Design

The interface is built as a **decision cockpit**, not a SaaS dashboard:

- **Palette**: Bone background, Ink primary, Oxblood accent — no purple gradients, no shadows
- **Type pairing**: Newsreader (serif, editorial) + IBM Plex Sans (UI) + IBM Plex Mono (numerals)
- **Layout**: strict left-alignment, hairline borders, generous spacing around hero metrics
- **Print**: `@media print` stylesheet preserves the document feel for PDF export

See `design_guidelines.json` for the full token specification.

## ✦ Environment Variables

| Name                    | Scope    | Required | Description                                                                          |
|-------------------------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MONGO_URL`             | Backend  | Yes      | MongoDB connection string (e.g. `mongodb://localhost:27017`)                         |
| `DB_NAME`               | Backend  | Yes      | MongoDB database name                                                                |
| `CORS_ORIGINS`          | Backend  | No       | Comma-separated allowed origins. Defaults to `*`. **Set explicit origins in prod**.  |
| `EMERGENT_LLM_KEY`      | Backend  | No       | Emergent Universal LLM key (or Anthropic key). If unset, narrative falls back to deterministic template. |
| `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` | Frontend | Yes      | Public URL of the FastAPI backend (e.g. `https://api.example.com`)                   |
| `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP`    | Frontend | No       | Set to `false` for production builds to suppress source map output                   |

Backend env lives in `backend/.env`; frontend env lives in `frontend/.env`. Both files are
git-ignored. A `.env.example` may be added to `backend/` if needed for collaborators.

---

## ✦ Security Posture (MVP)

This MVP is **intentionally unauthenticated** by product decision (see PRD). Read carefully
before any public production deployment.

### What is safe
- **No secrets in client bundle.** The frontend only knows `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`.
- **LLM API key** is server-side only and never appears in responses or logs.
- **Share tokens** use `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` → ~256 bits of entropy. Brute-force enumeration is computationally infeasible.
- **Shared route is strictly read-only.** Only `GET /api/shared/:token` is reachable without an internal handle; it performs only `$inc view_count` as a side effect.
- **Transit IDs are stripped** from the `/api/shared/:token` response — recipients of a share link cannot derive the originating `assessment_id` or `report.id`.
- **No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`** anywhere in the React tree; user-supplied initiative text is rendered as escaped text.
- **`.env` files** are explicitly excluded from git.

### What requires hardening before public production launch
- 🟡 **All `/api/assessments/:id/*` routes are unauthenticated.** Anyone with an assessment UUID can read, mutate, or regenerate the report. UUIDs are unguessable but logs/screen-shares are not. Add an auth gate before public deployment.
- 🟡 **`CORS_ORIGINS="*"` with `allow_credentials=True`** is permissive. Set explicit origins per environment.
- 🟡 **No rate limiting.** Add `slowapi` (or platform-level rate limits) on `/api/assessments/:id/report`, `/api/assessments/:id/share`, and `/api/shared/:token` before opening to the public.
- 🟡 **`POST /api/assessments/seed-demo`** is publicly callable. Gate behind an admin token (or remove) in production.
- 🟢 **Prompt-injection** via initiative free-text cannot alter scoring (deterministic) — worst case is degraded narrative quality. Acceptable for MVP.

### Data persisted
- `assessments` — initiative profile + evidence + metadata
- `reports` — scoring snapshot + LLM narrative
- `share_links` — token + executive abstract + view telemetry (`view_count`, `last_viewed_at`)

No user identities, no IP addresses, no PII are collected by design.

## ✦ Deployment Notes

### Pre-deploy checklist
1. Set `MONGO_URL`, `DB_NAME`, `EMERGENT_LLM_KEY`, `CORS_ORIGINS` (explicit origins, no `*`).
2. Set `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` to the production ingress.
3. Run `python backend/scripts/create_indexes.py` against the production database
   *(also runs idempotently at backend startup via `ensure_indexes`)*.
4. Disable the seed-demo route or gate it (see Security Posture).
5. Add rate limiting (recommended: `slowapi`) on share + report endpoints.
6. Disable source maps: `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false yarn build`.

### Runtime assumptions
- Python 3.11+, Node 18+, MongoDB 4.4+
- Backend memory ≤ 256 MB steady state; spikes during LLM I/O
- Cold-start latency on `/api/assessments/:id/report` is 4–8 s (single Claude call)
- Claude budget should be sized for ~1 narrative + ~1 abstract call per assessment

### MongoDB indexes
The following indexes are created idempotently at backend startup and can also be
created manually via `python backend/scripts/create_indexes.py`:

| Collection    | Key(s)                              | Unique | Purpose                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| `assessments` | `id`                                | ✓      | Fast assessment retrieval               |
| `reports`     | `assessment_id`                     |        | Report lookup by assessment             |
| `share_links` | `token`                             | ✓      | Public share resolution                 |
| `share_links` | `assessment_id` + `is_active`       |        | Idempotent share creation               |

### Backup recommendations
- Daily snapshot of `assessments`, `reports`, `share_links`
- Retention: 30 days for MVP; revisit for production
- Restore drill: weekly during the first month post-deploy

### Health monitoring
- Liveness probe: `GET /api/health` → expects 200 + `{ "status": "ok" }`
- LLM budget: monitor `EMERGENT_LLM_KEY` consumption on the Emergent dashboard
